<b>Hi I'm Ezra, I'm a first-year undergraduate student at the University of Manchester</b>

I have a strong passion for <b>music-based coding</b> and <b>audio software</b>, including <b>DAWs, VSTs, and digital plugins.</b> 
My interests lean toward the artistic side of computer science, where creativity and technology intersect.
I also enjoy designing things, bringing both aesthetic and functional elements into my work.

Right now, I'm intersted in learning and exploring <b>video and image manipulation</b> through coding, using technologies like <b>WebGL</b> and <b>OpenCV.</b>
